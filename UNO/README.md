This is my favourite Haskell project by far!

This project required extensive Data Type and Module creation.

The contain allows for a human and computer to play the game of UNO. The computer plays an _intelligent strategy_.

You can view the intelligent strategy as hard-coded rules as to what to play depending on what card is put down by a player.

Depth and breadth first searches are used to optimise this strategy.

If you are familiar with Haskell compatible GUIs then you can visualise the whole game in real time!

An outline of the intelligent strategy employed can be found in the Logic.md file.

Enjoy!
