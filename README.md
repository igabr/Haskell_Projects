This repo contains all the projects I completed in my journey to learn Haskell in **10 weeks**.

You should view this repository as an insight into my development and maturity with regards to Haskell syntax and fluency.

I am especially proud of the project where [Juan Arroyo Miranda](https://github.com/ju-arroyom) and I coded the game [UNO](https://www.unorules.com/) from scratch. The twist in this project is that we deployed an _intelligent strategy_ for when it is the computers turn to play a card.

The last project which codes up a visualization of [Schelling's Model of Housing Segregation](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf) still needs some work and optimization.

I hope you enjoy this repository as much as I enjoyed learning Haskell!
